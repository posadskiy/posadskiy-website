The converter ingests multiple FX providers, normalizes the feeds, and returns deterministic exchange rates for both retail and treasury workflows. It exposes a single dependency that teams can embed into JVM services or run as a gRPC/REST edge. The caching layer keeps cold-start latency below 25 ms, and regression suites ensure rounding stays IFRS-compliant when we expand to exotic currencies.
