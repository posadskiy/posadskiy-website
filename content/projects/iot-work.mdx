IoT Work ingests telemetry from custom sensors, applies anomaly detection on the edge, and pushes compact events to the cloud for orchestration. The fleet predicts heating/cooling decisions ahead of time, so rooms feel right without abrupt jumps. Building it forced me to treat firmware, Kotlin services, and dashboards as one cohesive product instead of silos.
