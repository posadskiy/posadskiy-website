REST Security ships pre-configured guards—rate limiting, audit trails, JWT validation, and consent enforcement—so product teams can focus on their domain logic. I maintain the release train, triage issues from the community, and keep the guidance aligned with the latest OWASP & OWASP API Security recommendations.
