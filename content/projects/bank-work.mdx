Bank Work consolidates CRM, tasking, onboarding, and compliance flows into a single secure workspace. We combined micro-frontends with a hardened Spring Cloud backend so managers can respond to clients from any device without losing auditability. Feature toggles let us roll out new flows to pilot branches while keeping the rest of the bank stable.
