Swing Teacher packages curated exercises, test harnesses, and UI previews into one teaching IDE. Students read a short brief, run the scaffold, then the app validates their implementation against unit tests. It is still one of my favorite mentoring tools when I onboard junior engineers into legacy desktop stacks.
