To avoid feast-or-famine learning bursts, Study Everyday pairs new articles with resurfaced highlights from past studies. Topics are modeled as MDX knowledge cards, so I can mix architecture diagrams with code snippets in one place. The dashboard rewards consistency, integrates with my calendar, and auto-suggests review sessions before context fades.
