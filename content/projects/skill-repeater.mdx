Skill Repeater keeps a catalog of personal and team-wide skills, tracks proficiency decay, and nudges you with tailored drills before muscle memory fades. The experience blends playful badges with analytics so mentees see exactly why a reminder arrives. It runs on React Native with offline storage and synchronizes progress via Firebase for instant, multi-device continuity.
