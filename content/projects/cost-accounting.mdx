What started as a weekend helper for my family evolved into a private-first finance cockpit. A Telegram bot ingests every purchase, recurring income, and presentation of monthly KPIs. The Java service classifies entries, syncs them to PostgreSQL, and exposes a lightweight dashboard so we can compare budgets vs. reality in real time. Each release stress-tests integrations with new banks, currencies, and household rituals while keeping audit history auditable via Git.
