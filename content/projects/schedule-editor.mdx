Schedule Editor was built to replace fragile spreadsheets used by faculty admins. It keeps classrooms, professors, and student groups in sync and exports read-only schedules to PDF/Excel for distribution. Conflict detection happens as you drag lessons around, which cut rescheduling time during exam seasons drastically.
