I partnered with product, risk, and compliance to rebuild the tooling used by 400+ relationship managers. We broke a monolith into Spring + Kafka services, standardized API contracts, and wrapped the result into a React shell for both desktop and mobile. My favorite win: playbooks that allowed squads to deploy on Fridays with confidence.
